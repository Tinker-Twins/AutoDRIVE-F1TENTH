Prerequisites:
--------------
- A bag file with an image topic recorded inside it
- MJPEG Tools [Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install mjpegtools]
- ffmpeg      [Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install ffmpeg]


Procedure:
----------
1. Start ROS master using the following command:
   roscore
   
2. Create a directory for the extracted images, cd in there and execute:
   rosrun image_view extract_images _sec_per_frame:=0.01 image:=</IMAGE/TOPIC/IN/BAGFILE>
   
3. Open a new terminal window, cd to the bag file path and execute:
   rosbag play <BAGFILE>
   
Notes:
------
- A sequence of image frames will be created in the directory using the naming style pattern: frame%04d.jpg
- Check if the number of frames created is the same as the number of messages in the bag file using rosbag info command.
- If the number of frames is less than number of image messages, decrease the _sec_per_frame value in step 2 of the procedure.
